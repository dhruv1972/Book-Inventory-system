# Book-Inventory-system

## Project Idea

The **Book Lending & Inventory System** is a web application designed to help manage the borrowing and inventory process of a library or small-scale book collection. The system will allow users to browse available books, borrow and return them, and track due dates. Administrators will have access to manage the inventory, users, and lending records.
